    "By increasing the interest in fairy tales, this application will contribute to the development of children's imagination and language development. On the other hand, fairy tales can be considered as a global tradition. In addition, the interaction of the nations of the world with each other is increasing day by day. For these reasons, AI trained with tales from different cultures will also play a role in increasing the interaction between cultures. Thus, HERORY will allow users to meet different worlds."
